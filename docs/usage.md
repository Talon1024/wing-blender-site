Usage
=====

Wing Blender can be used to import models from Wing Commander: Prophecy/Secret
Ops, or export models from Blender to Wing Commander: Prophecy/Secret Ops.

Importing a model
-----------------

Wing Blender 2.0 can import most models from Wing Commander: Prophecy/Secret Ops.
The models are imported in a way that they can be exported again. For more detailed
information, see [Importing a model](import.md).

Exporting a model
-----------------

Wing Blender 2.0 adds many more features in order to make object hierarchy
meaningful in terms of customization of model metadata, and the objects that
get exported.

You can customize the model metadata by parenting empties to any LOD of a
particular object, and you can export objects as children of other objects by
parenting them to other objects or hardpoints.

For more detailed information, see [Exporting a model](export.md).
